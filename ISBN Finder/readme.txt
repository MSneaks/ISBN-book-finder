In order to get the project ot learn we need to be connected to the Google Drive API. We need to go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a project.
Click enable apis and services.Search for Drive then click enable.We can then go to credentials on API dashboard and create web client credentials for this project. Download
that file and and add it to '/auth' folder.


//A bug in the project:
-No authentication-res file will break the project.
